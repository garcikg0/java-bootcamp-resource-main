During checkout, the app returns a receipt that includes a subtotal, tax, and total.
The tax rate is 13%.

               Test Cases
----------------------------------------
1. Subtotal equals the sum of every price.
2. Tax equals 13% of the subtotal.
3. Total equals subtotal + tax.



               NOTES
----------------------------------------
Test Drive Development: writing tests BEFORE writing code. Good code is easy to test. 
Bad Design - code isn't modular (performs too many tasks).
Not Modular = hard to test, vulnerable to bugs, hard to understand, not scalable.
Test Driven Development (TDD) helps achieve a modular design. 
Test Driven Development:
    1. Identify meaningful test cases.
    2. Write a unit test for each case.
        - write a test that fails.
            - make the test pass.
        - refactor if necessary
