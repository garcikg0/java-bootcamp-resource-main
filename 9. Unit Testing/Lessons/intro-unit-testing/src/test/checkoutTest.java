/**
 * Test Drive Development: writing tests BEFORE writing code. Good code is easy to test. 
 * Bad Design - code isn't modular (performs too many tasks).
 * Not Modular = hard to test, vulnerable to bugs, hard to understand, not scalable.
 * Test Driven Development (TDD) helps achieve a modular design. 
 * Test Driven Development:
 * 1. Identify meaningful test cases.
 * 2. Write a unit test for each case.
 *  - write a test that fails.
 *  - make the test pass.
 *  - refactor if necessary
